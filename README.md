JHUReviews is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) web app designed to help Johns Hopkins students evaluate courses they've taken and find high-quality courses. 

The client-side code is stored in this repository, while the server-side code is stored in a Heroku app. Besides MERN, this app uses Firebase for user authentication, Fuse.js for fuzzy search, and React Bootstrap for CSS styling.
